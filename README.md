## Why This Skill?

Content creators face a universal problem:

- __Design is hard__ — Not everyone can create professional visuals
- __Tools are expensive__ — Figma, Canva, and Adobe require subscriptions
- __Time is scarce__ — Learning design takes away from creating content
- __Consistency suffers__ — Each design looks different from the last

This skill solves all of that with a single command.

## The Solution

Describe what you want → Get publication-ready HTML cards → Export as PNG

```
You: "Make an infographic about Tailwind CSS layoffs"
↓
Claude creates: 4 stunning cards with data, quotes, and analysis
↓
You click: "Export All Cards" → 4 high-res PNGs downloaded
```

## What Makes It Different?

| Feature | This Skill | Traditional Tools |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| __Learning curve__ | Zero (just describe) | Steep |
| __Cost__ | Free | $10-60/month |
| __Time per design__ | ~30 seconds | Hours |
| __Consistency__ | Automatic (design system) | Manual effort |
| __Export quality__ | 2x resolution PNG | Varies |

In Claude Code, the skill will automatically activate when you:

- Ask to "make a poster", "create cards", or "design an infographic"
- Mention "visualize content" or "information graphics"
- Request "magazine-style design" or "editorial layout"

## Usage

### Example 1: Tech News

```
Create an infographic about this:

Tailwind CSS laid off 75% of staff. Revenue dropped 80% because
developers use AI tools like Cursor instead of reading docs.
The old business model (docs → traffic → sales) is broken.
```

**Output:** 4 cards with bold data visualization, dark-mode data card, and industry analysis

### Example 2: Educational Content

```
Make visual cards explaining:

What is Docker?
1. Containers package apps with dependencies
2. Run anywhere consistently
3. Faster than VMs, more isolated than bare metal
```

**Output:** Clean numbered list cards with definitions and use cases

### Example 3: Social Media Thread

```
Turn this twitter thread into cards:

[Thread about productivity tips...]
```

**Output:** Each tweet becomes a shareable card with consistent branding

## Design System

Every card follows strict design principles:

### The Style
- **Movement**: Modern Editorial + Swiss International Style
- **Philosophy**: Order, contrast, large typography, paper texture
- **Format**: 600px × 800px (3:4 ratio) — perfect for Instagram, Twitter

### The Colors
```
Background: #f2efe9  (Warm cream paper)
Text:       #1a1a1a  (Deep charcoal)
Accent:     #d95e00  (Hermès orange)
```

### The Typography
- **Noto Serif SC** (700, 900) — Headlines
- **Noto Sans SC** (400, 500, 700) — Body text
- **Oswald** (500, 700) — Numbers and English

### The Texture
- SVG noise overlay (opacity 0.06) for paper feel
- Deep shadows (25px blur) for floating effect
- Subtle gradients and opacity shifts

## Card Types

The skill intelligently divides content across 3-6 cards:

### Card 1: The Cover
- Massive percentage or key number
- Bold headline (48-56px)
- Short tagline

### Card 2-N: Content
- **List cards**: Numbered sections (01/02/03)
- **Data cards**: Dark background, large stats, key quotes
- **Mixed layout**: Text + visual elements

### Card N: The Outro
- Summary or call-to-action
- Generous whitespace
- Thoughtful closing
